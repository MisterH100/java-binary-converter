# ABOUT

This is a simple program that convert digits(from 0-255),ASCII text into binary and reverse.

# HOW TO RUN

- Copy this repo into you machine.
- Run `java src/ConvertToBinary.java -number 1` (this will convert the digit 1 into binary).

# CONVERT NUMBER TO BINARY

To convert numbers to binary:

- Use two arguments `-number <value>`.
- First argument is the value type you are converting.
- Second argument is the value from 0-255.

# CONVERT TEXT TO BINARY

To convert text to binary:

- Use two arguments `-text <value>`.
- First argument is the value type you are converting.
- Second argument is any ASCII text value, if your text is more that one word wrap it in double quotes.

  > Spaces are ignored, this is to be fixed

# CONVERT BINARY TO NUMBER

To convert binary to number:

- Use three arguments `-binary <value> -number`.
- First argument is the value type you are converting.
- Second argument is the value in 8 bit binary.
- Third argument is the return type of the binary value.

# CONVERT BINARY TO TEXT

To convert binary to text:

- Use three arguments `-binary <value> -text`.
- First argument is the value type you are converting.
- Second argument is the binary value, wrap binary value in double quotes.
- Third argument is the return type of the binary value.
